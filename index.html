          <p>
            <strong>
              The Car Garage Management System is a Java-based project designed to facilitate the efficient management of a diverse range of vehicles within a garage setting. This system accommodates three distinct vehicle types: regular cars, electric vehicles (EVs), and artificial intelligence (AI) cars. The project involves the creation of a well-structured class hierarchy, with a common abstract base class, "Vehicle," from which specific vehicle types inherit. The project emphasizes object-oriented principles, code modularity, and a user-friendly interface to provide an effective solution for car garage management. Thorough testing has been conducted to ensure the reliability and functionality of each component, reflecting a commitment to delivering a high-quality software solution.

      <h3>The Parent Pal</h3>

        <img src="images/fotor-ai-202312271132.jpg" alt="Parents and baby" height="200" />
        <p>
          <strong>
            The Parent Pal prototype introduces a revolutionary solution for monitoring and managing a child's sleep schedule. With a user-friendly interface, parents can input and save their child's sleep data, fostering seamless collaboration between co-parents by allowing the shared access of sleep schedules. What sets this app apart is its API integration, enabling users to access information about other children. By fetching data on various sleep patterns, habits, and recommendations, the app offers parents a broader perspective and valuable insights into their child's sleep behavior. Beyond mere data tracking, the app aims to create a supportive community by leveraging API capabilities to facilitate the exchange of advice and experiences among parents. The Parent App not only empowers individual parents with comprehensive sleep tracking but also fosters a collaborative and supportive network, enhancing the overall parenting experience.

        <p>
          <strong>
            The Virtual Pet Management System is a robust platform designed to streamline the comprehensive management of diverse pets and related activities. The system provides a user-friendly interface for tasks such as adding, updating, and removing pet records, managing shelter details, tracking volunteer schedules, maintaining adopter records, scheduling pet maintenance tasks, and admitting new pets to shelters. Its dynamic nature introduces real-time pet events, ensuring timely care and attention. The system's models encompass various pet types, shelters, volunteers, adopters, and maintenance tasks, each tailored with specific attributes. Enums define key characteristics, including pet temperaments, moods, types, and health states. User stories guide interactions for shelter managers, volunteers, and adopters, ensuring a seamless experience in pet care, adoption, and shelter management. The system's features collectively aim to enhance the efficiency of pet-related processes while prioritizing the well-being of animals in shelters.
